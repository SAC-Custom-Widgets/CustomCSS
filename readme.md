Custom CSS, Custom Widget

Custom widget which attaches a CSS <style> property to the page header,
allowing you to style your application with custom CSS statements.

CSS can be applied with a property in design mode or at runtime 
with a scripting method "setCss". The sample value of the property
makes the background of the app green.

While it is not technically prohibited to have several Custom CSS,
Custom Widgets in your application, it is not recommended, 
and all Widgets will use the same <style> property.
